Scenario: Analyzing a Simulated Population Dataset
You are tasked with analyzing the demographic distribution of a fictional population. To do this, you decide to create a simulated dataset containing 5000 individuals. The dataset will include information on each person's age and gender.

Steps You Took:
Simulated Data Creation:

You generated a dataset with 5000 random individuals, each assigned a random age between 18 and 65. The gender for each individual was also randomly assigned, with a slight bias towards males (55% male, 45% female).
Data Structuring:

You organized this randomly generated data into a structured format using a Pandas DataFrame. This made it easier to manipulate and analyze the data.
Population Analysis:

You analyzed the population distribution in two ways:
Age-Wise Population: You calculated how many individuals fall into each age group.
Gender-Wise Population: You counted the total number of males and females in the dataset.
Data Visualization:

You created two visualizations to represent your findings:
Age-Wise Population Chart: A column chart showing the distribution of individuals across different age groups. This allowed you to quickly see which age groups were more or less common in your dataset.
Gender-Wise Population Chart: A column chart showing the distribution of the population by gender, clearly depicting the number of males and females in the dataset.
Outcome:
Through this process, you were able to create a clear and visual representation of the demographic makeup of your simulated population, providing insights into the distribution of age and gender in the dataset. This approach is useful for understanding demographic trends and preparing for further statistical analysis or modeling.
